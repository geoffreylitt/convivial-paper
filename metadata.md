  Browser extensions and user scripts can modify web applications in useful ways, but many people have unique needs that aren’t met by existing extensions. Today, most of them are stuck—they can’t build their own browser extensions without learning how to program in Javascript.
  
  Wildcard is a platform that empowers anyone to build browser extensions without doing traditional programming. Wildcard shows a simplified view of the data in a web page as a table, and the table maintains a bidirectional connection to the original page. People can directly manipulate the table to sort/filter content, add annotations, and even use spreadsheet  formulas to fetch data from other websites.
