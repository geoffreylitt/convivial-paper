  Many people use Web applications that do not exactly meet their unique needs. While the Web platform supports client-side modification through user scripts and browser extensions, most people do not have the programming skills to implement such modifications. We wanted to build a system that enables end users to casually implement software tweaks without needing to learn traditional programming in Javascript.
  
  We present a prototype of a browser extension called Wildcard. Wildcard shows the main data from a web page in a table, and maintains a bidirectional connection between the table and the original page. By directly manipulating the data table, people can sort/filter content, add private annotations, and use spreadsheet formulas to fetch data from other web services.
  
  We present examples of using Wildcard to solve real world problems, and explain the design principles behind the prototype. In the future, we envision building Wildcard into a fully deployed system that makes the web into a more malleable medium.
