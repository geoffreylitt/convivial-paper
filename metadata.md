abstract: |
  Many Web applications do not meet the precise needs of their users. Browser extensions and user scripts offer a way to customize web applications, but most people do not have the programming skills to implement their own customizations.
  
  In this paper, we present a prototype of Wildcard, a live programming system embedded in the browser that empowers users to casually tweak web applications without needing to program in Javascript or interact with the DOM.
  
  Wildcard shows the data from a web page in a table, and maintains a bidirectional connection between the table and the original page. By directly manipulating the table, users can perform a wide variety of modifications: sorting/filtering content, adding private annotations, using spreadsheet formulas to fetch data from other web services, using custom UI elements to edit form data, and more.
  
  We present examples of using Wildcard to solve real world problems, and explain the design principles behind the prototype. In the future, we envision continuing to build Wildcard into a fully deployed system that helps make the web into a more malleable medium for all users.
