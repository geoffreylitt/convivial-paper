  Browser extensions and user scripts can modify websites in useful ways—ranging from blocking ads to adding entire new features to Gmail—but many people have unique needs that aren’t met by existing extensions. Today, most of those people are stuck. They can’t build their own browser extensions without learning how to program, so they have no choice but to accept the way the software was built. What if things were different?

  Wildcard is a platform that empowers anyone to build browser extensions and modify websites to meet their own specific needs. Wildcard shows a simplified view of the data in a web page as a familiar table view. People can directly manipulate the table to sort/filter content, add annotations, and even use spreadsheet-style formulas to pull in data from other websites. The key idea is that a table is a powerful, simple, and familiar paradigm for modifying a website.
