abstract: |
  Many people use Web applications that do not exactly meet their unique needs. While the Web platform supports client-side modification through user scripts and browser extensions, most people do not have the programming skills to implement such modifications.
  
  In this paper, we present a prototype of a browser extension called Wildcard, that empowers users to casually tweak web applications without programming. Wildcard shows the main data from a web page in a table, and maintains a bidirectional connection between the table and the original page. By directly manipulating the table, people can perform a wide variety of modifications: sorting/filtering content, adding private annotations, using spreadsheet formulas to fetch data from other web services, using custom UI elements to edit form data, and more.
  
  We present examples of using Wildcard to solve real world problems, and explain the design principles behind the prototype. In the future, we envision continuing to build Wildcard into a fully deployed system that makes the web into a more malleable medium.
