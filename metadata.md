  Browser extensions and user scripts can modify web applications in useful ways, but many people have unique needs that aren’t met by existing extensions. Today, most of those people can’t build their own browser extensions, since they can't program in Javascript.
  
  Wildcard is a platform that empowers anyone to build browser extensions without doing traditional programming. Wildcard shows the main data from a web page in a table that maintains a bidirectional connection to the original page. By directly manipulating the table, people can sort/filter content, add private annotations, and use spreadsheet formulas to fetch data from other websites.
