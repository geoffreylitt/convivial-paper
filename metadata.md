  Browser extensions and user scripts can modify web applications in useful ways, but many people have unique needs that aren’t met by existing extensions. Today, most of them are stuck—they can’t build their own browser extensions without learning how to program in Javascript.
  
  Wildcard is a platform that empowers anyone to build browser extensions without doing traditional programming. Wildcard shows the main data from a web page in a table with a bidirectional connection to the original page. People can directly manipulate the table to sort/filter content, add private annotations, and use spreadsheet formulas to fetch data from other websites.
